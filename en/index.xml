      <description>A short description about the author of the blog</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Leonardo, I&rsquo;m 22 years old and I&rsquo;m passionate about software development, at the moment my interests are Linux, networking, distributed systems and automation of <strong>anything</strong> that I need to do more than 1 time.</p>
<p>I started as a developer, and along the way I ended up bumping into DevOps practices (IaaC, CI/CD&hellip;) that were an excellent gateway to the operations area. Currently I work as a systems administrator, delving into subjects such as operating systems and networks, but without giving up programming.</p>
<p>If you want to contact me, send me a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lsgalves?locale=en_US">Linkedin</a> or an <a href="mailto:leonardosgalves@gmail.com">email</a>. My public PGP key is <a href="https://lsgalves.com/gpg.pub.asc">here</a>.</p>
